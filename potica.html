        Great-Great Grandma Chernick's Potica Recipe
        <div>
            <p>Dough</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cake or package of active dry yeast (2.25 tsp)</li>
                <li>0.25 cup warm water</li>
                <li>0.75 cup lukewarm milk</li>
                <li>0.25 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>0.25 cup soft shortening (crisco)</li>
                <li>3.25-3.75 cups flour</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Filling</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0.25 cup softened butter</li>
                <li>0.5 cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>0.25 cup milk</li>
                <li>0.5 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>0.5 tsp lemon extract</li>
                <li>2 cups ground walnuts (not chopped)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Directions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water.</li> 
                <li>Stir in warmed milk, sugar, salt, egg, and shortening. </li>
                <li>Mix in flour until dough is easy to handle. </li>
                <li>Turn out on lightly floured board and let stand for 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Knead until smooth and elastic, then round up in greased bowl. </li>
                <li>Bring greased side up, cover with damp cloth, let rise at 85&deg;F until hole remains when finger is pressed deeply into dough, approximately doubled in bulk -- about 2 hours. 
                    (tip: preheat oven at 250&deg;F for ~2 minutes, shut off oven, insert dough)
                </li>
                <li>Punch down, round up on board, cover. Let rest for 15 minutes. </li>
                <li>While dough is resting, prepare the filling: thoroughly mix the butter, brown sugar, and egg.</li>
                <li>Stir in the milk, vanilla, and lemon extract, then blend in the walnuts. </li>
                <li>Place dough on a large floured cloth and roll it out almost paper thin into a rectangle, 20x30".</li>
                <li>Spread filling over dough, bringing it to the edges.</li>
                <li>Starting at the wide side of the rectangle, lift cloth and let dough roll up like a jelly roll. Seal well by pinching edges into dough.</li> 
                <li>Place in greased, oblong pan (13x9.5x2") or onto greased cookie sheet in snail shape.</li>
                <li>Let rise until impression remains when dough is touched gently -- about 1 hour. </li>
                <li>Heat oven to 325&deg;F (slow moderate)</li>
                <li>Bake 40-45 minutes. If top browns too quickly, cover with brown paper. </li>
                <li>Let cool before slicing. </li>
            </ol>

            Eat it as-is, butter it and microwave for a few seconds, or my personal favorite: top it with a thick slice of ham.
